# ToDo list

## Description

This is a dead simple todo list. It uses an html file along with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [store.js](https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js) to display your tasks and save them in the web storage (aka local storage) of your browser.

## Usage

Open this todo helper couldn't be easier. Just open the index.html in your browser. (A double click should be enough, or drag n' drop it into your browser window.)
This tool should be self-explanatory. You can add a new task, edit it or delete it. Provided you finished this task.
If you're on vacation and have tasks left over - simply clear the whole list :)
Every time you make changes to your tasks, the list of them will immediately be updated.

Your tasks can contain html list, headings or anything that a JSON.stringify can handle.
Since this tool doesn't need a server, the only one you can damage is yourself.

## Offline first

This package contains all files to work directly from within the browser. It does not need a server to list, save or change your tasks.
If you really want to use this tool online, simply put the package onto your server. Make sure that the index.html is in your web root directory.
Now you can surf to your server. The index.html will be automatically served (standart settings).



Have fun playing with this tool.
But I'm not responsible if you break anything while using it.
